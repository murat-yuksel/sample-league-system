# Sample League System #

## Purpose ##
This project started for a job application and became a challange after a while.

## What it does now ##
Now we can start a league and build the fixture, see all matches, point table and play matches week by week or all once.

## How to setup ##
Simple; prepare a database using sql file in the repo, change db configurations on /class/db.php and hit the index.php

## So what ##
What about adding some features or improve especially fixture algorithm. At least you can test and add new issues. All wellcome.
